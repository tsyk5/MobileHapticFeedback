**MobileHapticFeedback** is a cross-platform haptic feedback library for **Unity**,  
providing a unified API for **iOS (Core Haptics / UIKit)** and **Android (VibrationEffect)**.

It allows you to use UIKit-style feedback, parameterized one-shot impacts,
and waveform-based haptic patterns with a consistent programming model across platforms.

## Features
- **iOS**
  - Core Haptics–based impacts (CHHapticEngine)
  - UIKit-style feedback (Impact / Selection / Notification)
- **Android**
  - VibrationEffect-based haptics (API 26+)
- **Unity**
  - Unified cross-platform API
  - Safe no-op behavior when haptics are unavailable or muted

> **⚠️ Note (Android)**  
> UIKit-style feedback and Core Haptics–like APIs are conceptually mapped to  
> the closest available vibration patterns supported by the platform.

## Supported Platforms
- iOS 13+
- Android API 26+
- Unity 6000.0 or later

## Installation ( Unity Package Manager )

Add via Git URL: 
```
https://github.com/tsyk5/MobileHapticFeedback.git?path=package/com.tsyk5.mobilehapticfeedback
```

To install a specific version, append a tag:
```
https://github.com/tsyk5/MobileHapticFeedback.git?path=package/com.tsyk5.mobilehapticfeedback#v0.2.0
```


## Quick Start

### UIKit-like APIs

```csharp
MobileHapticFeedback.PlayImpact(ImpactStyle.Medium);
MobileHapticFeedback.PlaySelection();
MobileHapticFeedback.PlayNotification(NotificationType.Success);
```
These calls are safe to use without checking availability.

If haptics are unsupported or muted by OS/user settings, calls may simply do nothing.

### Core Haptics-like API ( One-shot impact )

```csharp
MobileHapticFeedback.Prepare();
MobileHapticFeedback.PlayImpact(intensity: 0.6f, sharpness: 0.3f, durationSec: 0.2);

MobileHapticFeedback.Stop();
```
Parameters
- `intensity` (0..1): Strength of the haptic.
- `sharpness` (0..1): Crispness / sharp edge of the haptic (iOS only).
- `durationSec` (sec): Duration of the haptic.

> <b>⚠️ Note (Android)</b>: <br/>
Android does not support the sharpness parameter.<br/>
Changing this value does not affect vibration behavior.

### Patterns API （ Waveform-style ）

```csharp
MobileHapticFeedback.Prepare();


var durationsSec = new float[]
    {
        0.6f, 0.15f
    };
var amplitudes = new float[]
    {
        0.1f, 0f
    }
MobileHapticFeedback.PlayPattern(durationsSec,amplitudes);
```
Parameters

- durations (sec): Duration of each segment.
- amplitudes (0..1): `0` means silence.`1` means maximum strength.

## Samples ( Sample01 )

The following patterns are available in the Sample01 scene.

After building the Sample01 scene, press the buttons in each section to
test and experience the haptic feedback behavior on a real device.

> ⚠️
<br/>Haptics cannot be reproduced in the Unity Editor.Please run the sample on a physical device.

### ⭐️ Core Haptics-like API ( One-shot impact )

<img src="images/unity-pattern-one-shot.png" width="520" />

This section demonstrates a single, parameterized haptic impact.

Adjust the sliders and press “Play Impact” to trigger the haptic.

Press “Stop” at any time to interrupt playback, even during the duration.

### ⭐️ Patterns API （ Waveform-style ）

<img src="images/unity-patterns.png" width="520" />

Construct custom haptic patterns by combining explicit
duration (time) and amplitude (strength) values.

All patterns can be interrupted at any time by pressing “Stop”.

### SOS

<img src="images/pattern-sos.png" width="520" />

Represents the Morse code SOS (… --- …) using haptics.

Short and long pulses are combined to form a clear emergency signal.

### Heartbeat

<img src="images/pattern-heartbeat.png" width="520" />

A rhythmic pattern inspired by a human heartbeat.

Double pulses and pauses create a natural, biological rhythm.

### StepUp

<img src="images/pattern-stepup.png" width="520" />

A pattern where haptic intensity gradually increases over time.

Useful for expressing buildup, progress, or emphasis.

### ⭐️ UIKit-like APIs

<img src="images/unity-uikit.png" width="520" />

UIKit-style haptics follow Apple’s system-defined haptic behaviors.

These APIs provide standardized feedback patterns for common UI interactions,
ensuring consistency across iOS applications.
